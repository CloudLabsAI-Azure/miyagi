# Lab 1: Bringing your own data with Azure AI Search

### Estimated Duration: 120 minutes

## Lab objectives 

In this lab, you'll run Chat Copilot locally after retrieving Azure OpenAI Service values from the Azure portal. By cloning the Chat-Copilot GitHub repo and setting up dependencies, you'll configure and execute the application. Uploading documents enables interaction with Copilot, which generates responses based on their content, complete with citations for validation. This exercise provides hands-on experience in utilizing Chat Copilot with your own data, managing documents and sessions within the application.

    > **Note**: Click on the **Expand** button, if you don't see the left side navigation pane.         

### Task 2: Cloning the Chat-Copilot GitHub Repo

In this task, you will clone the Chat-Copilot GitHub repository by using Git commands to download the code to your local machine for further exploration and development.

1. In the LabVM, click on **Start**, from the start menu search and select **PowerShell** and pen PowerShell as an administrator.

    ![](./Media/data5.png)  
   
1. Navigate to the directory `C:/Users/azureuser` by running the command below.
 
   ``` 
   cd C:/Users/azureuser
   ```
1. Run the command to clone the GitHub repository.
   
   ``` 
   git clone https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/chat-copilot CHAT-COPILOT
   ```
1. Open Visual Studio Code from the LabVM Desktop and click on `File (1) > Open folder (2)`.

   ![](./Media/file-1.png)

   ![](./Media/ch4.png)

   > **Note**: If the pop-up appears for **Do you trust the authors of the file in this folder?**, click on **Yes, I trust the authors.**   

### Task 3: Setting up the Environment

In this task, you will set up the environment for the Chat-Copilot project by installing necessary dependencies, configuring environment variables, and preparing the development environment for local execution.

1. Open PowerShell as an administrator on your local machine. You need to have PowerShell Core 6+ installed, which is different from the default PowerShell installed on Windows.

   ![](./Media/data5.png)

1. Set up your environment by navigating to the scripts directory of chat-copilot using the command:

   ``` 
   cd C:\Users\azureuser\chat-copilot\scripts\
   ```

1. Run the below command to install Chocolatey, dotnet-7.0-sdk, nodejs, and yarn:

   ```
   .\Install.ps1
   ```

   >**Note:** If you receive an error that the script is not digitally signed or cannot execute on the system, you may need to change the execution policy or unblock the script.

### Task 4: Configure and run the Chat Copilot App locally

In this task, you will configure and run the Chat Copilot app locally by setting up the environment, adjusting configuration files, and launching the application for testing and development.

1. Configure Chat Copilot by running the following command. You can use the Azure OpenAI Service Name, Key, Endpoint, and the already deployed model names that you noted down in the previous steps or use the values from the below mentioned table.
   
   ```
   .\Configure.ps1 -AIService {AI_SERVICE} -APIKey {API_KEY} -Endpoint {AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT} -CompletionModel {DEPLOYMENT_NAME} -EmbeddingModel {DEPLOYMENT_NAME}
   ```
   | **Variables**                          | **Values**                                            |
   | ---------------------------------------| ------------------------------------------------------|
   | API_KEY                                | **<inject key="OpenAIKey" enableCopy="true"/>**       |
   | AI_SERVICE                             | **AzureOpenAI**| 
   | AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT                  | **<inject key="OpenAIEndpoint" enableCopy="true"/>**  |
   | CompletionModel:{DEPLOYMENT_NAME}      | **<inject key="CompletionModel" enableCopy="true"/>** |
   | EmbeddingModel:{DEPLOYMENT_NAME}       | **<inject key="EmbeddingModel" enableCopy="true"/>**  |

   >**Note:** If a Security warning pop-up window appears, choose **Yes**
   >
   >**Note:** The code should look similar to the image below:

     ![](./Media/data8.png)

1. Run Chat Copilot locally. This step starts the **backend API** application. frontend
 
   ```powershell
   .\Start-Backend.ps1
   ```
   > **Note:** It may take a few minutes for Yarn packages to install on the first run.
 
1. Open another tab in **Edge**, in the browser window, paste the following link, and you should see a confirmation message: `Healthy`.
 
   ```powershell
   http://localhost:40443/healthz
   ```
   > **Note:** Don't close the PowerShell window, keep it running up.
  
     ![](./Media/data9.png)
    
1. In the LabVM, click on **Start**, from the start menu search and select for **PowerShell 7**.

   ![](./Media/data10.png)
 
1. Run the following command to change the path.
 
   ```
   cd C:\Users\azureuser\chat-copilot\scripts\
   ```
 
1. Run the following to set the execution policy.
 
   ```
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
   ```
 
1. The execution policy helps protect you from scripts that you do not trust. Changing the execution policy might expose you to the security risks described in the about_Execution_Policies help topic. If prompted **Do you want to change the execution policy?,** enter **A** and hit **Enter**.
 
1. Configure **Chat Copilot** by running the following command.
 
   ```powershell
   .\Start-Frontend.ps1
   ```

1. Once the deployment of the script is executed successfully, it will redirect to `http://localhost:3000/` Chat CoPilot in **Edge** browser.
 
   >**Note:** Please wait for 2-3 minutes for the browser to load
  
1. You will get an output similar to this for the frontend:

   ![azure](./Media/data11.png)

1. You will get an output similar to this for the backend:

   ![azure](./Media/data12.png)
