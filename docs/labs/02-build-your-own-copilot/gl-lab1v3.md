## Task 2: Understanding the implementation of the Recommendation service

In this lab, you will explore the implementation of the Recommendation service, focusing on its algorithms and data processing methods to deliver personalized suggestions.

Recommendation service implements RAG pattern using Semantic Kernel SDK. The details of the implementation are captured in the Jupyter notebook in the folder miyagi/sandbox/usecases/rag/dotnet. You can open the notebook in VSCode and run the cells to understand step-by-step details of how the Recommendation Service is implemented. Pay special attention to how the RAG pattern is implemented using Semantic Kernel. Select kernel as .NET Interactive in the top right corner of the notebook.

1. In the Visual Studio Code, navigate to **miyagi/sandbox/usecases/rag/dotnet** folder and select **Getting-started.ipynb**

   ![](./Media/image-rg-23.png)

1. **Execute the notebook cell by cell** (using either Ctrl + Enter to stay on the same cell or Shift + Enter to advance to the next cell) and observe the results of each cell execution.
  
   > **Note**: Make sure **.Net Interactive** is in ready State, if not please wait for 15 to 20 seconds. Also, please do not click on the **Run All** option to execute all the cells at a time,e this may lead to exceeding in token limit that resulting in Error: 503 â€“ Service unreachable. 

      ![](./Media/run.png)

   > **Note**: Ensure to install Python extensions before running the cells.
   
   > **Note**: Ensure to click on **Work or School Account** when a window opens and provide the username and password
   
   > **Note**: In case of any issues or errors occur related to the exceeded call rate limit of your current OpenAI S0 pricing tier. Please wait for 15 to 20 seconds and re-run the cell
