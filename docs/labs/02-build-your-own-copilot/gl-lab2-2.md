# Lab 2: Explore and Verify the Containerized Recommendation service in Azure Container App using Local Miyagi UI

### Estimated Duration: 60 minutes

## Lab Scenario

In this lab, you will explore and verify the containerized Recommendation Service deployed in Azure Container Apps using the local Miyagi UI. Begin by configuring the Miyagi UI to connect to the Azure endpoint of the Recommendation Service. Next, test various API calls through the UI to ensure accurate recommendations based on user inputs. Document any discrepancies or issues encountered during testing. Finally, validate the overall integration and functionality of the services.

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Verify the Recommendation service running in the Container App by Personalizing
- Task 2: Update Container App Recommendation service URL for Miyagi UI
- Task 3: Access Recommendation Service running on Azure Container Apps from Local Miyagi-UI

## Task 1: Verify the Recommendation service running in the Container App by Personalizing

In this task, you will verify the Recommendation service running in the Container App by personalizing recommendations based on user preferences and testing the service's responses.

1. In the Azure Portal page, in the Search resources, services, and docs (G+/) box at the top of the portal, enter **Container Apps (1)**, and then select **Container Apps (2)** under services.
